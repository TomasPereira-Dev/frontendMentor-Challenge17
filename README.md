# Audiophile

This project is part of Frontend Mentor's catalogue of project ideas.  

The goal was to (based only on a few images) do a complete E-commerce page with a fully responsive design.

## Run It Locally
>[!NOTE]
This is assuming you have both Node.js and git installed, if not, do it before start.
  
first clone this repo in your terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/TomasPereira-Dev/frontendMentor-Challenge17.git
```

Then change the folder you are into with

```
cd ./frontendMentor-Challenge17
```

Once you are there, Install everything with 

```
npm install
```

And run it.
```
npm run dev
```

## Tech I Used
I mainly used React, JavaScript and Tailwind for the styling, all the data used for this project  
came from a local JSON file, no APIs involved (yet).

## Plans for the future
I want to add a payment prossesor for debit/credit card transactions by the end of April 2024  
most probably Mercado Pago, I don't know if I need to learn about backend for this, so it might took me more time than that.
